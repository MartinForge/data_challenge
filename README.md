# Live Code Challenge

Given a set of students (under the students folder) and a set of classrooms
(under the classrooms folder) write a python script that generates a CSV file
as an output with the following columns student_name, student_age, classroom_color.
filter out records with incomplete data. You may have to rename some of the columns
for adjunting it to the expected output.
